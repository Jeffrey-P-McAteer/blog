### That which arguments are made of

I figured I'd include a section for anime I've been recommended and ended up disliking. I respect my friend's ability to enjoy the shonen-of-the-month but please don't inflict it on me.

- [My Hero Academia](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academiahttps://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia)
- [A Certain Magical Index](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index)
    - Yes I love Railgun. Yes I hate Index. Deal with it.
- [Fire Force](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38671/Enen_no_Shouboutai)
- [ALDNOAH.ZERO](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22729/AldnoahZero)
    - This started out *really* good, and then turned into the normal netflix garbagefest about halfway through.
