This document covers life habits I have learned,
both positive and negative alongside their identifying
characteristics and side effects.


# Positive

## Magnets for cable management

The cables I use every day can be put into 2 categories:
cables that never move (ethernet) and cables that move all the time (phone chargers).

For the second category, use magnetic breakaway cables and keep metal surfaces nearby
so the cables can be docked nearby when not in use.


## Primary sources of information

The vast majority of data online is written by 3rd-party observers, meaning the story has
gone through 3,4,5,6,7,8 etc. pairs of ears before reaching you. If you have ever played a
game of telephone you know how accurate information is even after the 2nd retelling.

Whenever possible being at an event is more informative than hearing from a direct contact (2nd-party),
and hearing from a 3rd-party observer is next to useless in the 21st century.

Some useful 2nd-party sources:

 - https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-basics-industry/search-databases

# Negative


## Listening to audio with only one headphone

I commonly wear headphones to listen to telecon/music/videogame audio without
disturbing those around me. I value situational awareness, which results in
keeping one earpiece on my ear and one off so I can keep track of the audio in 2 environments.

This is awful over 1+ weeks of use. My brain ends up getting used to the two audio profiles and when
switching ears the difference is phenomenal - the cost of splitting attention is that you don't pick
up on 2nd-order details in the audio feed (speaker background, bass, spies decloaking),
only the most recognizable symbols (speaker voice, melody, sentry gun chatter).

## Unnecessary english words and phrases

English contains many useless determiners that aid the spoken form
but are unnecessary in the written form. The following mappings
will make written documents faster to read:

 - `PRONOUN also PHRASE` -> `PRONOUN PHRASE`
    - `He also fishes` -> `He fishes`
    - `She writes code and also bakes` -> `She writes code and bakes`


## Habits

Habits are going to form no matter what your plans are,
so the best tactic is to develop stupid controlled habits
in place of unknown uncontrolled habits. Ideally you'd
develop intelligent controlled habits but my experience
is when planning intelligent habits too much energy is
invested determining "what should I do?" and almost zero
energy is left over for committing to the new habit.
