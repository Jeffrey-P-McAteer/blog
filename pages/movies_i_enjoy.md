## Stuff I'm a fan of...

_...but it's disorganized and/or not great enough for the first list_

 - [The Alien movie franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(franchise\))
    - I don't think I've seen them all, only the 1986 film and Prometheus
 - [Good Will Hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Will_Hunting)
    - It's too emotional for me but Robin Williams has some great lines
 - [Dead Poets Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Poets_Society)
    - Same thing, Williams has some great scenes but the rest of the film falls short
 - [Django Unchained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Unchained)
    - This probably deserves to be in the first list, I'd have to see it again.
      Great acting from what I remember, can't remember if the plot made sense.

## Stuff I want to see

 - Weathering with You
