# Gift Ideas

Friends complain that buying me presents is impossible because

 - They don't know what tools I need
 - My movie taste is absurd and I rarely watch them anyway
 - My music taste is absurd
 - 

Many friends have complained that I'm a difficult person
to buy gifts for; mostly because I buy my own tools and
there isn't much besides tools that I like (possibly food).
