# Perceptive Hash Face Digest

I have a python script which captures pictures of my face every hour or so,
which I use in other projects for visual authentication or whenever I need
an AI dataset of faces.

One side effect of this is I can run it through [a script to pair perceptual hashes into a video][0]
and create something neat like this:

<video controls autoplay>
  <source src="perceptive_hash_face_digest_2020.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
