# Highschool Dragon Model

Recently I was complaining to someone about the new blender 2.8+
UI which got rid of tons of shortcuts I'd memorized (like right-click to select pretty much anything, now it pops open a menu
like "normal" software).

Anyway I mentioned my modeling was better in highschool
and the project I always talk about is this one:

[Dragon.zip](Dragon.zip)

![Render](Render.png)

There was a 3d model of the dragon that took about 5 hours to print
in the school library and to my knowledge it is still there.

The model turned out better than the render by a large margin so
if anyone has a photo get in touch.
